# pH Level Forecasting of Well Water Samples in Malawi

This project dwells on Forecasting pH levels of water samples in Malawi, which was conducted by Leeds Beckett University. The project went through Preprocessing, Regression as well as Classification.

## Preprocessing
The Preprocessing took an EDA analysis and some measure which is hihglighted below
